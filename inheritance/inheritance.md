# Inheritance

## Definition/ Overview
 In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties and behaviors of the "parent object" (with the exception of: constructors, destructor, overloaded operators and friend functions of the base class). 

 Inheritance can be used when you observe a 'kind-of' or 'is-a' relationship between classes. You can say, for example, that "a dog is an animal" or "a dog is a kind of animal".
 
 Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.
