# OOP


## Access Modifiers
Access modifiers modify the default scope of variables. There are three types: public, private, and protected.

### Public-- 
Can be accessed anywhere inside or outside the class

### Private-- 
Can _only_ be accessed inside the class

### Protected-- 
Can be accessed within the class and its sub-classes
