# Polymorphism

## Definition/ Overview
Polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to exhibit different behaviours depending on the object on which the method is invoked.

> "Do X for a collection of various types of objects, where X is different depending on the type of object"

A novice OOP programmer will most likely encounter polymorphism when a method, inherited from a parent (super-) class, has its implementation changed to better suit the child (sub-) class. This process is called *overriding*.

The significance of polymorphism is that the object itself knows which implementation of a method to use.
